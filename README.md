My name is _Victor_. I love solving problems. I'm  a web developer and an engineer (strong focus on physics and energy).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [personal website](https://chroniclesofhades.com) as well as a website for the school that I am currently working with. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about NixOS. I've been using it on my daily driver and I love it. Expect the dotfiles soon (as soon as I wrapp my head around flakes)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any challenging project.
